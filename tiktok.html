                    <h4>3D Modeling</h4>
                    <p>When I started my internship, the final 3D model hadn't been completed yet by the design team. So I was responsible for taking a temporary low poly 3D model and cleaning it up and rigging it.</p>

                    <h4>UI Design</h4>
                    <p>The filter was something completely new and fairly complex that TikTok hadn't featured before, so there were a lot of different elements that needed to fit on the page and a lot of information to communicate to the user. I spent about a week or two out of my internship to focus on the UI of where all the different elements would go, which elements we would need to leave out for clarity's sake, how instructions will look, when certain instructions would trigger, and how long they would trigger for. I made many sketches of different combinations of the elements and presented them to my mentor and my team.</p>
