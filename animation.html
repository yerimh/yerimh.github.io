            <!-- 3D ANIMATIONS -->
            <p>These are the shots I animated, lit, and rendered in the final film. In the process, we watched a lot of videos of flying squirrels, as well as filming ourselves acting out the shots to reference for more human-like actions and emotions. We received feedback weekly and refined our shots for nearly twenty weeks, up to the day of the premiere.</p>

                <div class="detail">
                    <p>This was my most complex shot. It had the most movement like climbing, jumping and landing on the branch, taking off the basket, and climbing out. It was a huge challenge to fit it all into the time frame I was given for the shot.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If I were to go back to revise it, I would make the motion of taking off the basket slow-in slow-out more, and add more anticipation to the baby squirrel's jumps crawling out.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Otherwise, I'm really proud of the three jumps at the beginning (especially the anticipation), and the detail of the baby squirrel's pupils moving back and forth between her mom squirrel's eyes. Also, props to our editor for the hand slap cut!</p>

                <div class="detail">
                    <p>The biggest challenge for this shot was getting the baby squirrel's hands to where she could reach the helmet on her head. She was so fat and her arms so short that lifting it to where the hands actually touched the helmet would cause her wings to clip through her armor. I had to break a few bones and cheat a little bit with perspective to achieve the final look!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I'm also really satisfied with how the mom squirrel's leap off the branch turned out with the timing and anticipation.</p>

                    <p>For this shot, I enjoyed working on the emotion of the baby squirrel sighing and looking off in the distance. I find pleasure in the subtleties of emotions, and I had a lot of fun acting through the character.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If I were to go back to this shot, I would revise the mom squirrel's landing so that her footing is more solid and doesn't slide, and add some more follow through, as well as move her pupils so it looks like she's actually looking at the helmet on the ground.</p>
